# osu_miss_explainer

A program that reads [gosumemory](https://github.com/l3lackShark/gosumemory) websocket and reads a random article on wikipedia when the player misses.

Currently, the program is set to run in turkish, but it can be edited in source code.

Inspired by [this youtube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNGTfbDUcZM)
